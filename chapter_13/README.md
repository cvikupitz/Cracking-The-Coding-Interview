#### 13.1 - Private Constructor

In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

#### 13.2 - Return from Finally

In Java, does the finally block get executed if we insert a return statement inside the try block of a try-catch-finally?

#### 13.3 - Final, etc.

#### 13.6 - Object Reflection

#### 13.7 - Lambda Expressions

There is a class _Country_ that has methods _getContinent()_ and _getPopulation()_. Write a function:

```java
int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent)
```

that computes the total population of a given continent, given a list of all countries and the name of a continent.

#### 13.8 - Lambda Random

Using Lambda expressions, write a function:

```java
List<Integer> getRandomSubset (List<Integer> list)
```

that returns a random subset of arbitrary size. All subsets (including the empty set) should be equally likely to be chosen.
