Although generics and templates look similar in code, they are both handled by the compilers differently.

In Java, generics are handled via type erasure, which removes parameterized types and inserts appropriate type casts to preserve compile-time safety. For example, if we compiled the following code:

```java
List<Integer> al = new List<Integer>();
al.add(10);
Integer I = al.get(0);
```

The Java compiler will produce something like this:

```java
List al = new List();
al.add(new Integer(10));
Integer I = (Integer) al.get(0);
```

You could write a Java program like the one above, but this style introduces some problems. It may produce runtime error(s) as we cannot guarantee that the List contains only integers. Generics in Java allow us to do away with casting and ensures that all items in List are integers. It also makes the code easier/nicer to read.

For C++ templates, a separate copy of the class or function that uses templates is made for each new type that uses it. Templates also allow for primitive types and instantiation of parameter types. For example, say we have the following code:

```c++
T max(T x, T y) {
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}

int i = Max(1, 3);
float f = max(1.0, 3.2);
```

Notice we invoke _max()_ two times, but with different types, with integers and floats. The C++ will generate two copies of the templated function to accommodate the two types used, so we might end up with something like:

```c++
int max(int x, int y) {
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}

float max(float x, float y) {
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}

int i = Max(1, 3);
float f = max(1.0, 3.2);
```
