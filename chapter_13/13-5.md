A HashMap stores items given a key-value pair and uses a hashing function to insert, access, and remove its data. Collisions are handled with singly-linked lists. A LinkedHashMap is essentially the same as a HashMap, but uses doubly-linked buckets to handle collisions. The LinkedHashMap will store its items in insertion order while the HashMap does no such thing; the ordering is arbitrary. Both allow _O(1)_ for inserting, searching, and deleting items. The TreeMap stores its items in a binary tree, and orders its elements based on its natural ordering (e.g., with integers, 3 comes after 1, 5 after 4, etc.). Its runtime for inserting, search, and deleting items is _O(log N)_.

For very large amounts of data, the HashMap or LinkedHashMap is preferable for its constant access time. If the ordering matters (in terms of insertion), the LinkedHashMap is useful. For example, a LinkedHashMap is useful for building a cache system that needs to replace the oldest inserted item with a new one. If the natural ordering of the items matters, then you would use a TreeSet. For example, you might use one to print out a long list of dictionary words in alphabetical order.
