By keeping the constructor of a class private in Java, you cannot instantiate said class. In terms of inheritance, this means that the class cannot be extended, since the call _super()_ refers to a private method.



You should also mention the fact that any inner classes inside the public class can access the private constructor. This means that sub-classes can be created as inner classes, as this is the only way the private constructor can be called.
