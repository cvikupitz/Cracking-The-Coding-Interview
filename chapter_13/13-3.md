The keywords *final*, *finally*, and *finalize* all sound similar, but have different meanings in Java.

##### final

The *final* keyword is a  modifier applicable to Java variables, methods, and classes. It indicates that the assigned entity can only be assigned to something once and can never again be reassigned. This means slightly different things in terms of classes vs. methods vs variables, as described below.

A final variable is a variable that can be assigned a value once, but can never be reassigned. Note that a final object can still have it's members modified, but not the object itself.

```java
final int x;
x = 10; // This is fine

final String y = "Hello World!";
y = "Illegal reassignment"; // Throws a compilation error

final List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(1);
list.add(2); // Method calls on a final object are still legal
list = new ArrayList<>(); // Throws a compilation error
```

A final method is simply a method that cannot be overridden by a subclass.

```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {}
    public final void move() {}
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        LOGGER.info("Meow");  // This is fine
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void move() {
        LOGGER.info("Moving...");  // Throws a compilation error
    }
} 
```

A final class is simply a class that cannot be sub-classed (extended by another class).

```java
final class Bot {
    public void speak() {
        LOGGER.info("Nothing can extend me!");
    }
}

class Robot extends Bot {  // Throws a compilation error
    public void move() {
        LOGGER.info("Moving...");
    }
} 
```



##### finally

The *finally* keyword is used along with *try* and *catch* and indicates a block of code that should always execute after the try and catch branches, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

```java
try {
    LOGGER.info("-- in TRY block");
    throw new RuntimeException();
} catch (Exception e) {
    LOGGER.info("-- in CATCH block");
} finally {
    LOGGER.info("-- in FINALLY block");
}
```

The above code snippet should output the following:

```
-- in TRY block
-- in CATCH block
-- in FINALLY block
```



##### finalize

This is a method in the *Object* class that is invoked before being deleted by the garbage collector. It usually is used for cleaning up an object's open resources (files, database connections, etc.) prior to deletion. Note that garbage collection is never guaranteed to happen for an object (even when it becomes eligible), therefore you should never rely on it for resource cleanup.
