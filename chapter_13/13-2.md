Short answer: yes.

The main thing to remember is that the code inside of a finally block will always execute, regardless of what code exists inside either the try or catch blocks.

##### Example 1

The following snippet should print the following:

```java
try {
    LOGGER.info("In TRY block");
    return 1;
} catch (Exception e) {
    LOGGER.info("In CATCH block");
    return 2;
} finally {
    LOGGER.info("In FINALLY block"); // This will get printed
}
```

```
In TRY block
In FINALLY block
```

##### Example 2

If a catch block is ever executed, the finally block will still execute. The following snippet should print the following:

```java
try {
    LOGGER.info("In TRY block");
    throw new RuntimeException();
} catch (Exception e) {
    LOGGER.info("In CATCH block");
    return 2;
} finally {
    LOGGER.info("In FINALLY block"); // This will get printed
}
```

```
In TRY block
In CATCH block
In FINALLY block
```

##### Example 3

One thing to remember: any return statements inside a finally block will execute over any return statements inside either the try or catch block. This means that the return statements in the try or catch block(s) will never be executed. Refer to the example code snippet below:

```java
private static int test() {
    try {
        LOGGER.info("In TRY block");
        throw new RuntimeException();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        LOGGER.info("In CATCH block");
        return 2;
    } finally {
        LOGGER.info("In FINALLY block"); // This will get printed
        return 3;
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println(test()); // This will print '3'
}
```

```
In TRY block
In CATCH block
In FINALLY block
3
```
