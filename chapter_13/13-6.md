Object reflection in Java allows us to examine and/or modify the behavior of methods, classes, or interfaces at runtime. Through reflection, we can get the name of a class, its constructor(s), and a list of all its methods and parameters. This allows us to find out a class’s method and parameter(s), and invoke these methods, regardless of its access type (we can use reflection to retrieve protected/private members and methods).

Reflection is useful if you need to examine how an application behaves at runtime, and can help with debugging (some debuggers use object reflection). You can also use object reflection to retrieve class information from an application if you need it, but don’t have access to the source code. In general, object reflection is not used since it can be very slow and breaks encapsulation.
