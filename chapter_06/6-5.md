Since we have no measuring cups, and the jugs are oddly shaped, we can only measure the amount of water we have by transferring water from one jug to the other. We can easily solve this by transferring the water as follows:

* Fill the 5-quart jug all the way full, then fill the 3-quart jug full using the 5-quart jug. We should now have exactly 2 quarts of water in the 5-quart jug.
* Empty the 3-quart jug, and transfer the 2 quarts of water from the 5-quart jug to the 3-quart jug.
* Fill the 5-quart jug full, then fill up the 3-quart jug with the water from the 5-quart jug. Exactly 1 quart will be added to the 3-quart jug since we already have 2 quarts in, which will leave exactly 4 quarts left in our 5-quart jug.
