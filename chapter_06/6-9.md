First, it helps to think about when each door is toggled. If you thought about the problem carefully, you probably figured out that locker _i_ is toggled on pass _j_ if _j_ is a factor of _i_, that is, if _i mod j_ is 0. For example, locker #22 is toggled on passes 1, 2, 11, and 22 (all factors of 22). Once we know this, we know that a locker is left open when it is toggled an odd number of times.

Imagine any number and its list of factors. Take 20 for example; its factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. Take 32; its factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. You’ll notice that most numbers have an even number of factors; so what numbers have an odd number of factors? Perfect squares do. Take 1 for example; its factors are only 1. Take 4; its factors are 1, 2, and 4. Take 9; its factors are 1, 3, and 9. One of the perfect square’s factors only contributes one factor to the sequence, and is not counted twice on a pass (e.g. for locker #9, it is only toggled once on pass #3). Knowing this, it’s easy to figure out how many lockers are left open. The perfect squares between 1 and 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. Therefore, 10 lockers are left open.
