Since no interview is available, Iâ€™ll make some assumptions, otherwise make sure to clarify your assumptions with your interviewer.
* _Who will use it, and why?_
I will assume students (high school and college) will primarily use it for note taking.
* _What are the use cases?_
The pen should be able to write on any piece of paper, but should not write on any other surface, such as walls, clothing, etc.
* _What are the bounds of use?_
The pen should write as long as it has ink left. It should also not bleed through more than 1 sheet of paper, and the ink must dry within 3 seconds after writing.
* _What are the stress/failure conditions?_
If the pen is out of ink, damaged, etc., it should simply not write. If we try to write on a different surface other than paper, the ink should not dry itself.
* _How would you perform the testing?_
We will test the pen by writing on every type of paper available, and should expect it to write cleanly. We will test a pen with no ink, and a damaged pen, and should expect it to not write on any surface. We will also test the pen by writing on non-paper surfaces. The pen should write, but the ink should not dry; we should be able to clean off the ink from walls, clothing, etc.
