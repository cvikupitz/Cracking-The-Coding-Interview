Since we are given the function to test, we can probably assume we will do white box testing.

The people who will use this are the players of chess, most likely playing on a standard 8x8 chess board. The use cases include all the valid and invalid positions on the board the piece can move to. I’ll assume that the stress/failure conditions are to return false. After all, you can’t move a piece to a non-existent tile off the board.

In addition, we will also need to test each individual piece, since different chess pieces have different rules as to where they are allowed to move. For example, when testing a queen, we need to make sure the queen can move forwards, backwards, sideways, and diagonally as much as the user wants. One the other hand, when testing the king, we should expect the king to be able to move any adjacent tile, but can only travel one tile at a time.

Since we are doing white box testing, we can write some test code/cases to test this function. It might look something like this:

```powershell
for each piece in set:
    move piece to random tile (x, y)
    for i in range 0 … i - 1
        for j in range … j – 1
            boolean result = canMoveTo(i, j)
            print “[piece] can move to [i][j] : [result]”
```
