```c
unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
    printf("%d\n", i);
```

There are 2 problems with the above code snippet:

* The variable *i* is an unsigned integer, and the for loop will only terminate if *i* is less than 0. Since unsigned integers can never be less than 0, this will result in an infinite loop.
* The format specifier in the print statement is incorrect; the correct specifier for unsigned integers is *%u*.
