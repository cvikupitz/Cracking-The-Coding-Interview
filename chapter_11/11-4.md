Load testing is when we test a system’s behavior under different levels of stress. Generally, this is testing by examining the service’s throughput, response time, and identifying any apparent bottlenecks.

Since we have no access to any tools, we will create our own testing clients. Each client will be configured to make random requests to the webpage at random times, and will measure the response time and throughput. We can create as many clients as we want and run some number of them concurrently. With some number of client concurrently running making requests, we can see how the webpage would perform under both normal, and very stressful conditions.
