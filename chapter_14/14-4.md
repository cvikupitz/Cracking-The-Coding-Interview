There are 4 main types of joins outlined below:

#### Inner Join

This join returns all records with matching entries in both tables. This type of join is useful if we want to only get matching records from the two tables.

#### Left Join

This join returns all records from the left table, along with any records from the right table with matching entries. All left table entries are returned regardless of the number of matches in the right table. If we want to gather all the records from one table, and join them with any records with matching properties from the other table, this type of join is useful.

#### Right Join

This join returns all records from the right table, along with any records from the left table with matching entries. All right table entries are returned regardless of the number of matches in the left table. This type of join is the same as the left join, just inversed.

#### Full Outer Join

This join returns all records from both tables, regardless if there are any matches in either table. This type of join is useful for getting all records from both tables if matching records is not needed or relevant.
