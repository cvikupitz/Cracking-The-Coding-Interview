In database theory, denormalization is a technique used to improve the read performance of a database. This technique is done by adding redundant data from one related table into another in order to reduce the number of table joins.

Imagine we have a table for artists, another for genres, and another for songs. If we wanted to fetch all the information on a given song, we would have to perform table joins on the artists and another on the genres, which can be costly. With denormalization applied, all the song's genre and artist information would be stored in additional columns in the songs table, thereby eliminating the need to perform additional table joins.

##### Pros

* Retrieving data is faster with less table joins.
* Queries are simpler and less error-prone.

##### Cons

* Inserting, updating, and deleting data is more expensive. We must update information in both the main table(s) and all the related tables.
* Queries for inserting, updating, and deleting data are more complex to write.
* Redundant data will require additional storage.
