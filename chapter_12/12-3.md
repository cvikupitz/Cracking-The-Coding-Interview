A hash table is a giant array that stores items given a key-value pair for each. The key given is passed into a hashing function, which converts the key into an integer, which is the index where the value is/will be stored at. Keys that share a common index are said to be collided, and are handled by storing the items in a linked list. An STL map, on the other hand, stores the key-value pairs into a self-balancing tree (can either be AVL or Red-Black).

| Property            | STL Map                        | HashTable    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Iteration Order** | Sorted Order                   | Arbitrary    |
| **API Complexity**  | _O(log(N))_                    | _O(1)_       |
| **Null Key/Values** | One null key, many null values | None allowed |
| **Is Synchronized** | Yes                            | No           |

If the number of inputs is small, an STL map will likely not differ from a hash map in performance. As the input gets very large, a hash map is preferable.
