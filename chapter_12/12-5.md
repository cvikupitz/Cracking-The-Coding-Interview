A shallow copy of an object does not copy the original object’s elements, only the structure itself. If object A holds a reference that points to another object in memory, then a shallow copy of A, say object B, will hold the same reference to the same object. A deep copy of A, however, will not only copy the structure, but any references to objects that A points to in memory.

A shallow copy suffices in most cases, however if you want to copy and modify an object without affecting the original, then a deep copy is needed. Example of both shown below:

```c
struct container {
    char *name;
    int size;
};

/* A shallow copy of the container struct ‘c’ */
struct container *shallow_copy(struct container *c) {
    struct container *dup = (struct container *)malloc(sizeof(struct container));
    dup->name = c->name;
    dup->size = c->size;

    return dup;
}

/* A deep copy of the container struct ‘c’ */
struct container *deep_copy(struct container *c) {
    struct container *dup = (struct container *)malloc(sizeof(struct container));
    dup->name = (char *)malloc(strlen(c->name) + 1);
    strcpy(dup->name, c->name);
    dup->size = c->size;

    return dup;
}
```
