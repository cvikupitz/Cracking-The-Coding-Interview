We already know why virtual functions exist; to allow subclasses to override a base class’s function and achieve runtime polymorphism. What if our subclass contained new members that our base class didn’t have? What would happen if those members were dynamically allocated?

We always need to declare our base class’s destructor as virtual. Whenever we destroy an object, the subclass’s destructor will automatically be invoked, even if the object points to its base class. This will ensure that we are calling the destructor of the most derived class, and all allocated resources are properly freed/returned. Otherwise, this may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.
