To understand the volatile keyword, one must also have a basic understanding of how the C compiler works.

There is a stage in the compilation process known as optimization. At this stage, the compiler will examine and rewrite your code to make it use less resources, run faster, etc., but still behaves exactly the same way. For example, suppose we have the following code:

```c
int main() {
    int flag = 1;
    while (flag == 1)
        /* Do nothing, busy wait */;
    return 0;
}
```

Youâ€™ll notice that this produces an infinite loop since flag is never modified in the while loop. The optimizer will notice the flag variable is never used inside the source file, which unnecessarily consumes memory, and may change your code to the following:

```c
int main() {
    while (1)
        /* Do nothing, busy wait */;
    return 0;
}
```

However, what would happen if flag was modified somewhere outside the source code? The while loop would never check this condition, and would continue running, even if flag is set to a value that would terminate the loop. Applications that work with hardware, signals, interrupts, or uses the fork() system call usually access variables outside its source code. Therefore, to fix this, use volatile as such:

```c
int main() {
    volatile int flag = 1;
    while (flag == 1)
        /* Do nothing, busy wait */;
    return 0;
}
```
