A virtual function is a function within a C++ class that can be overridden by its subclasses. When you refer to a derived class using a reference of pointer to the base class and invoke its virtual function, the derived class’s version will be invoked. Virtual functions are used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

But how does the C++ compiler achieve this? When we create a C++ class and declare one of its functions as virtual, the compiler will construct what’s called a _VTable_. A hidden pointer that points to this table is then added into the class. If a subclass does not override the virtual function(s) in the base class, the address of the base class’s function is stored in the _VTable_. This allows us to write code like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
  public:
    virtual void msg() {
        cout << “I am a person.” << endl;
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
  public:
    void msg() {
        cout << “I am a student.” << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Person *p = new Student;
    p->msg();
}
```

The output of the above should be:

```
I am a student.
```
